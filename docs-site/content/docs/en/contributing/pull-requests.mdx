# Pull Requests

This guide covers the process for submitting pull requests to Bingsan.

## Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** - Look for related issues or discussions
2. **Open an issue first** - For significant changes, discuss the approach before coding
3. **Fork the repository** - Create your own fork to work on

## Creating a Pull Request

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Sync your fork
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-gcs-support` - New features
- `fix/namespace-deletion-bug` - Bug fixes
- `docs/update-api-reference` - Documentation
- `refactor/simplify-auth-flow` - Code refactoring

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the [Code Style Guide](/docs/contributing/code-style)
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good
git commit -m "Add GCS storage backend support"
git commit -m "Fix race condition in namespace deletion"

# Bad
git commit -m "fix bug"
git commit -m "update"
```

### 4. Run Tests and Lints

Before submitting, ensure all checks pass:

```bash
# Run linter
make lint

# Run tests
make test

# Run integration tests (if applicable)
make test-integration
```

### 5. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then open a pull request on GitHub.

# Performance

Bingsan is optimized for high-throughput metadata operations with minimal memory overhead.

## Overview

Bingsan implements several performance optimizations:

- **Object Pooling** - Reuses memory buffers to reduce GC pressure
- **Distributed Locking** - PostgreSQL-based locks with configurable timeouts
- **Optimized Serialization** - Uses goccy/go-json for fast JSON encoding

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Typical |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Table metadata serialization | &lt;50ms | ~10us |
| Large schema (100+ cols) | &lt;200ms | ~90us |
| Memory allocation reduction | &gt;=30% | 19-26% |
| GC pause (p99) | &lt;10ms | &lt;5ms |
| Pool hit rate | &gt;=80% | ~100% |

## Configuration

Pool and locking settings are configured in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
catalog:
  lock_timeout: 30s
  lock_retry_interval: 100ms
  max_lock_retries: 100
```

Or via environment variables:

```bash
ICEBERG_CATALOG_LOCK_TIMEOUT=30s
ICEBERG_CATALOG_LOCK_RETRY_INTERVAL=100ms
ICEBERG_CATALOG_MAX_LOCK_RETRIES=100
```
